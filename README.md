# Athenaeum

Papyrus is a mobile app where people can create and join book clubs to discuss books they are reading.

It's a project that I have been steadily working on since October of 2023. It is a project that I continue to work on with two friends, because we believe that books should be experienced together, and that book clubs should be a lot more common. This is version 2, which is for now discontinued. I'm currently working on version 3, and you can write me an email at me@samersawan.com if you'd like to see it.

## Note

Papyrus is now Athenaeum. I'm currently working on the third version of the project, as well as a web version using NextJS, TypeScript and NodeJS

### Papyrus Versions

Papyrus v1 was first built in Swift, but I realized that I wanted to make the app accessible to everyone, and I am not able to build the app in two languages (Kotlin and Swift) on my own, which is why we decided to switch to Flutter

Papyrus v2 is built in Flutter, and is the current repo you are looking at

Athenaeum (v3) is being built in React Native, features many UI improvements and QOL features added to make using the app seamless. Eventually I will make that repository public as well.
